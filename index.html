            Any minute now, my ship is coming in
            I'll keep checking the horizon
            I'll stand on the bow, feel the waves come crashing
            Come crashing down down down, on me

            And you say, be still my love
            Open up your heart
            Let the light shine in
            But don't you understand
            I already have a plan
            I'm waiting for my real life to begin

            When I awoke today, suddenly nothing happened
            But in my dreams, I slew the dragon
            And down this beaten path, and up this cobbled lane
            I'm walking in my old footsteps, once again
            And you say, just be here now
            Forget about the past, your mask is wearing thin
            Let me throw one more dice
            I know that I can win
            I'm waiting for my real life to begin

            Any minute now, my ship is coming in
            I'll keep checking the horizon
            And I'll check my machine, there's sure to be that call
            It's gonna happen soon, soon, soon
            It's just that times are lean

            And you say, be still my love
            Open up your heart, let the light shine in
            Don't you understand
            I already have a plan
            I'm waiting for my real life to begin
